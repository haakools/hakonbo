As I am sure, you have no idea who I am or why I am writing what possibly nobody will bother about. I am (as of writing) 25 year old, newly graduated with a Masters degree in Geoscience (specializiation in Geophysics) looking for a job. But the aim of this site is necessarily not to get a job, but during my job search I have found that hard skills such as math and programming needs to accompanied by highly sought after soft skills.

During this realization I understood that this is not some untangible skill, but rather something that can be trained. By writing on this site I aim to share things I find interesting and communicate those ideas. After all, it is only by doing something that you become good at it.

As for other reasons that come to mind: from my own experience it is always clarifying to write things down. Putting your thoughts into words, black on white, have helped me get a much more clear picture of things.
